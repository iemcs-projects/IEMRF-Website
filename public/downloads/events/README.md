Current mapping in `lib/event-downloads.ts`:

- `e-pa-1` → `/downloads/events/Agile-Project-Management.pptx`

When you add PPTs, name them exactly as in the mapping or update `lib/event-downloads.ts`.

Example:
- `public/downloads/events/Agile-Project-Management.pptx`
- `public/downloads/events/Another-Event.pptx`

You can add new mappings in `lib/event-downloads.ts` using the `pptMapping` object.
