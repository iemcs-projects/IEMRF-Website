Place startup details files here for direct download via the Startups page.

Naming & Mapping
- By default the Startups page will look for a details file at:
  `/uploads/projects/details/startup/<id>.pdf`
  (generated by `getProjectDownloadUrl("startup", id)`)

- Alternatively, for explicit control you can add a `detailsPath` field to the startup entry in `lib/startups-data.ts` and set it to a public path (for example `/downloads/startups/chrysalis-details.pdf`).

Examples
- `public/downloads/startups/chrysalis-details.pdf`
- `public/downloads/startups/eduﬁ-overview.pdf`

Notes
- Files placed under `public/` will be served at the root path.
- For best browser download behavior, provide a same-origin public path (i.e., `/downloads/...`).
